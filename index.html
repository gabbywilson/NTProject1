          <h2>Similarities</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-par">
          <p> &emsp; &emsp; The biggest similarity across the four gospels is the portrayal of Jesus Christ as a loving Savior who came to serve and minister to everyone. Each author shared stories and parables that showed Christ performing miracles and teaching everyone that would listen. These four disciples were divinely chosen to take up the sacred task of recording Christ’s life and ministry. In the Four Gospels, the writers each follow a very similar progression of events. They first start by declaring Christ is a divine being, then move on to Christ performing miracles and teaching. After that, the writers wrote about his death, which included the betrayal, trial, and ultimately Christ’s death. Lastly, we read about the resurrection of Christ and then him visiting the people.</p>
          <p> &emsp; &emsp; There are a lot of similarities between Mark, Matthew, and Luke. These similarities include the sequence of events and certain stories. There are theories that the similarities came to be because Matthew and Luke used Mark and potentially another source when writing their accounts. This is called the synoptic problem, and the two main theories are called the Two-source Hypothesis and the Farrer Hypothesis. The Two-source Hypothesis claims that Matthew and Luke were copied from Mark and a source named “Q” that hasn't been found. The Farrer Hypothesis claims that Mark inspired both Matthew and Luke, as well as Matthew inspiring Luke. These theories would help explain why there is a lot of similarity in the verses as well as the stories recounted.</p>

             <h2>Differences</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="section-par">
              <p> &emsp; &emsp; While there were a lot of similarities found in the Four Gospels, each author had a different audience they were writing to, and that affected how they portrayed Christ. Mark, for example, was writing to the Romans, and that was part of the reason he portrayed Christ as the suffering son of God who served everyone. Matthew wrote to the Jewish people, so the Christ he showed was the most Jewish and fulfilled a prophecy. This is clear in Matthew 2:2 where the wise men say, “Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” Luke was writing to the Greeks, and that meant his Christ was to be shown as the Savior for all people. He also portrayed Christ as having human emotions, which allows the reader to connect better to the Savior. This is demonstrated in Luke 4:2, “Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing; and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.” Lastly, John was writing for members of the Church of Jesus, so John focused on portraying a Christ that was the divine son of God.</p>
             <p>&emsp; &emsp; John is the one gospel that has the least similarities to the other three. For one, it only shares 8% of the other gospels, while Matthew, Mark, and Luke share 41-93%. John also focuses the most on the last week of the Savior’s life, with it totaling 10 chapters. John’s focus on the last week of Christ’s life is most likely because he was a disciple of Christ and was present during the last week and the crucifixion. It’s unlikely that the other writers met Christ, but were rather followers of Christ’s apostles. This led them to have a different perspective of Christ because they were learning about him from other people instead of having their own experiences with him.</p>
